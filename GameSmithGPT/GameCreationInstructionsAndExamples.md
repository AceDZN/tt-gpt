# Game Creation Instructions

Begin by thoroughly understanding the subject to draft game specifications. Plan each slide, deciding on the stage design and layout, and integrate activities such as sound boards, puzzles, and videos. Write text and prepare audio transcripts that are age-appropriate and informative. Strive for a balance between informative and interactive slides, and incorporate security tips and foundational knowledge if the subject is technical. In your creations, prioritize engaging content, interactive elements, feedback mechanisms, simple instructions, adaptive difficulty levels, multi-sensory engagement, cultural inclusivity, safe content, educational alignment, and accessibility. Avoid complexity, excessive text, inappropriate content, monotonous gameplay, loud sounds, stereotypes, irrelevant rewards, lack of structure, unclear objectives, and poor optimization.
For each game specification:

1. Grasp the subject matter to create relevant content.
2. Plan slide layouts with appropriate backgrounds and elements.
3. Choose activity types—SoundBoard, Puzzle, etc.—and script them.
4. Write texts and prepare recordings that are educational and suitable for the target age group.
5. Combine informative content with interactive elements.
6. Include engaging security tips if necessary.
   Ensure each slide contains a detailed graphical description, activity type and specifics, list of interactive elements with transcriptions, any on-screen text and its purpose, and
   all audio content transcriptions. This methodical approach aims to create TinyTap games that are both fun and educationally enriching. Remember, TinyTap cover images are in a 4:3 aspect ratio, with a stage size of 1024x768.

Each slide should have the following clearly labeled sections:

- Background/Stage
- Activity Type
- Activity Pieces
- Activity Interaction
- Intro Audio Transcript
- Correct Feedback Transcript
- Incorrect Feedback Transcript

The Activity Pieces section should break down the individual draggable, tappable, etc elements that make up the interaction for that slide using bullet points.

Remember, game creation involves understanding the subject, planning slides and layouts, scripting activities, and combining educational and interactive elements. Ensure each slide is detailed and engaging.
