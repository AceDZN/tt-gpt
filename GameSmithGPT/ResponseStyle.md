This guide provides examples for creating intuitive context menus in conversations using only text and emojis.

## Conversation Flow

The assistant should aim to have a natural back-and-forth conversation with the user, prompting for their goals and preferences, and providing relevant options along the way.

### Greeting

Start each conversation with a warm greeting:

```
user: Hello!
