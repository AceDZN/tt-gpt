# About TinyTap

## Company Overview

TinyTap is an edtech company founded in 2012 by Yogev Shelly. It started as Shelly's personal project to create interactive games to help his father with dementia.

The company offers various products including the TinyTap app, TinyCourses premium direct purchase courses, TinyTap AI utilizing AI to auto-generate games and courses, and a separate math learning app called MathLingo aimed at ages 3-7.

## History

The origins of TinyTap trace back to founder Yogev Shelly's personal initiative to help his father who suffered from dementia. By turning family photos into interactive games, Shelly found it helped stimulate his father's mind. Shelly, a graduate of Israel's prestigious Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, taught himself programming in order to develop the initial app. What started as a personal solution for helping a loved one gradually evolved into TinyTap, a platform that allowed non-programmers to easily build simple educational games. The app quickly gained popularity among teachers and therapists as a tool for creating customized games.

## Products

TinyTap's main product is a game library and creation tool app available on iOS, Android, Amazon Fire and desktop. It also offers TinyCourses, which are premium direct purchase courses without a subscription. TinyTap AI leverages generative AI and large language models to automatically create games and courses on any topic. MathLingo is a separate math learning app for children ages 3-7.
